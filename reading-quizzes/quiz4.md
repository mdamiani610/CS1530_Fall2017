1. Does every software system have an architecture?  Why or why not?

2. You are designing a climate control system, which accepts inputs from a variety of distributed sensors (e.g., thermometers, smoke sensors, barometers, etc.), and normalizes environmental conditions based on this input.  For example, if average temperature is below a threshold, the heater will be turned on.  Occasional input needs to be responded to immediately; for example, a smoke sensor detecting particulate matter may set off a fire alarm immediately.

Of the architectural styles listed in Tsui _et al_, which one would be best for this kind of system?  Why?

3. You are designing a system to store classes so that students can view information on the classes available for the next semester.  There is little to no business logic associated with this system.  The focus is just on storing and viewing (and for administrators, occasionally adding) data to the system.

4. After reviewing your system design, your co-worker notes that you have two classes with content coupling.  Why is this problematic?

5. You have written a class whose methods are all related in terms of some control sequence.  What level of cohesion is this?
