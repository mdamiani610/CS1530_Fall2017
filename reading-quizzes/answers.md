# Answer Key for Reading Quizzes

## RQ1

1. Joy of making things, making things useful for others, always learning, etc.
2. 105
3. Adding engineers to a late software project makes it later
4. Design constraint, because it refers to the technical aspects of the system (how it should do it) as opposed to what the system should do
5. Effort estimation and schedule, Assignments and communications

## RQ2

1. Code errors (coding errors, errors of code, etc. are all acceptable)
2. Requirements phase.  Reasons: Because errors can propagate throughout the system, one requirement error can turn into several design/implementation errors, cheaper/faster to fix requirements errors, should be problem-preventative, quicker to test, better to find errors earlier so that they have less impact.
3. Respect others and strive for fairness, Perform to one's best capability, Follow the law
4.   A description of any interaction between the system software and something external
5. Optimizing (Level 5) Three key processes: Defect prevention, Technology change management, Process change management

## RQ3

1. The product owner is the voice of the customer, represents the customer and their wants and needs.
2. Product backlog, sprint backlog, increment, burndown chart
3. Agile methodologies have more frequent, crucial, ongoing communication with customers.  Traditional methodologies tend to have less frequent communication, with most, if not all, communication at the beginning and end of the software development process.
4. Requirements analysts need to be able to translate between the domain which the software is written for, and the technical team.  They require good industry domain knowledge and communication skills which are not often found in junior
5. An actor refers to all external interfaces to the system (human users, other systems, etc.)

## RQ4

1. Yes, every system has a software architecture.  If a system exists, it has some architecture, even if it is informal or undocumented.
2. Event-driven architecture.  Its primary method of operation is responding to events. (I will accept client-server since the server operates fundamentally differently than the attached clients)
3. Database-centric, since it is focused on data storage.  (I will also accept client-server since data is stored on a central server and clients access it, or MVC if you assume it is web-based as I mentioned that many web frameworks use MVC)
4. Content coupling is a very tight coupling.  This can lead to changes in one leaking over to another, hard to localize fixes, hard to re-use the code elsewhere.
5. Procedural cohesion.  I would also accept communicational, sequential, or functional since they are also "procedural plus".

## RQ5

1. Planning, Organizing, Monitoring, Adjusting
2. Total person-days = 1120
3. Refactoring
4. Repeat of the code
5. (several answers possible here, just need one: performance optimization reduces readability/maintainability, commenting increases readability but increases cost of maintaining, a more secure system often makes it less usable, etc.  There are lots of possibilities!)
