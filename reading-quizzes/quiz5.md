2. You are developing a system which you estimate will need 20 classes.  There will be one very simple GUI interface.  Based on previous productivity of your team, it takes 16 person-days to fully develop one class.

Using the Lorenz-Kidd OO estimation technique, estimate how long it will take (in person-days) to complete the project.  Show your work.

3. In your code, you have a very long method, `extrapolateDucksAndFish()`.  Reviewing the code, you are able to deconstruct it so that the method calls three new, shorter  methods, `initializeAnimals()`, `extrapolateDucks()`, and `extrapolateFish()`.  In the process, you are also able to remove some duplicate code, leading to an overall reduction of 35% in terms of lines of code, without changing any of the functionality.

What is the name of the process that you just did?
